  <center> <h3> Haridwar - Gateway to Land of Gods</h3> </center>
  <p>
    Haridwar serves as the Gateway to the Char Dhams of Uttarakhand and Dev Bhomi. The ‘Panch Tirth’ or the five pilgrimages located within the periphery of Haridwar, are Gangadwara (Har Ki Pauri), Kushwart (Ghat), Kankhal, Bilwa Tirtha (Mansa Devi Temple) and Neel Parvat (Chandi Devi). Haridwar is also one of the four places; where Kumbh Mela occurs after rotation of every twelve years and Ardh Kumbh after every six years.</p>
    
    <p>Haridwar has not only remained the abode of the weary in body, mind and spirit, but also served as a centre of attraction for learning the arts, science and culture. Haridwar has a long standing position as a great source for Ayurvedic medicines and herbal remedies as well as its unique Gurukul school system of traditional education. Rajaji National Park is just 10 kms from Haridwar. It’s an ideal destination for wildlife and adventure lovers.</p>
    
    <p>In the evening, the Ghats look breathtakingly beautiful as thousands of Diyas (lamps) and marigold flowers float and illuminate the holy waters. Haridwar as today, does not only have a religious importance, but it is also famous for The Roorkee University, at Roorkee which is one of the oldest and the most prestigious institute of learning in the fields of science and engineering. Another university of the district i.e. Gurukul having a vast campus also provides traditional educations of its own kind.</p>
